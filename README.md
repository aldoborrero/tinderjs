# TinderJs [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aldoborrero/tinderjs.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/aldoborrero/tinderjs)

[TinderJs](https://tinderjs.com/) is an unofficial web application client written in [AngularJs](http://angularjs.org) for [Tinder](http://gotinder.com). 
The main purpose on why I decided to start this project is because I wanted to learn more about Angular. Also I opened a YouTube channel where I document my development efforts as I'm coding this app (audio is in spanish, though).

Also you can visit my other related project [TinderJs for Android](http://github.com/aldoborrero/tinderjs-android).
